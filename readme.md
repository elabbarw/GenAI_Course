# GenAI Course: From Python Fundamentals to Advanced GenAI Applications

Welcome to the GenAI course, a comprehensive guide designed to take you on a journey from the very basics of Python to the advanced realms of Generative AI (GenAI). Whether you're just starting out with Python or looking to dive deep into advanced GenAI concepts, this course has something for everyone.

## Python Fundamentals

Dive into the basics of Python programming to build a strong foundation.

- [Python Fundamentals](0-python_fundamentals.md): Covers basic concepts like print statements, variables, lists, loops, and dictionaries.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into GenAI, it's essential to set up your environment and gather all necessary credentials.

- [Setup Guide](1-setup_guide.md): Provides instructions on setting up your Python environment, installing necessary packages, and organizing your credentials.

## Dive into GenAI

Once you've grasped the Python basics and set up your environment, it's time to explore the world of Generative AI.

1. [Basics Notebook](2-basics.ipynb): Introduces the installation and setup of required packages, demonstrates basic interactions with the OpenAI API, and discusses the concept of "memory" in chatbot interactions.
2. [Prompts Notebook](3-prompts.ipynb): Showcases the importance of designing effective prompts and explores various prompting techniques.
3. [RAG Notebook](4-rag.ipynb): Delve into the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and learn how to use external sources to enhance model responses.
3. [RAG using Microsoft Bing on Azure](4a-rag-bing.ipynb): RAG function example based on Azure Bing instead of duckduckgo.
4. [Vector RAG Notebook](5-vector_rag.ipynb): Understand the concept of vectorizing documents and their applications in conjunction with RAG.
5. [Automatic Speech Recognition & Text to Speech](6-ASR_TTS.ipynb): Discover OpenAI's ASR and TTS capabilities.
6. [OpenAI GPT 4 Vision](6-vision.ipynb): Discover OpenAI's Vision capabilities. This requires tier-1 access in OpenAI (Spend $6+). It is not available with the free tier.
7. [OpenAI Assistants](7-assistants.ipynb): Look into how to create AI assistants.

## Play with chatbots

1. [Chatbot guide](chatbots.md): Guide on how to prepare the environment for the chatbots
1. [Basic Chatbot with ASR, TTS and Vision (OpenAI Tier-1)](basic_chatbot.py)
2. [Advanced Chatbot with ASR and TTS + Function Calling API](advanced_chatbot.py)
3. [Socrates - a chatbot based on OpenAI Assistants and threads with ASR and TTS](chatbot_assistants.py).


### Note about GPT4-vision: In order to get access to GPT4 vision preview you need to buy at least $0.50 of credits on your OpenAI account. You can also buy $6 of credits and you will be upgraded to tier-1 which gives you access to such models as well as higher rate limits.
